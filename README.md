## Air Quality and Pollution Assessment Classification Model

### Key features of the dataset
- Temperature (°C): Average temperature of the region.

- Humidity (%): Relative humidity recorded in the region.

- PM2.5 Concentration (µg/m³): Fine particulate matter levels.

- PM10 Concentration (µg/m³): Coarse particulate matter levels.

- NO2 Concentration (ppb): Nitrogen dioxide levels.

- SO2 Concentration (ppb): Sulfur dioxide levels.

- CO Concentration (ppm): Carbon monoxide levels.

- Proximity to Industrial Areas (km): Distance to the nearest industrial zone.

- Population Density (people/km²): Number of people per square kilometer in the region.

### Target Variable: Air Quality Levels
- Good: Clean air with low pollution levels.

- Moderate: Acceptable air quality but with some pollutants present.

- Poor: Noticeable pollution that may cause health issues for sensitive groups.

- Hazardous: Highly polluted air poses serious health risks to the population.
